<h2>Description</h2>
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System) is a tool security professionals use to analyze logs from different sources such as Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and much more. It helps security professionals to monitor, prioritize, and remediate threats in real-time. Azure Sentinel (Microsoft Sentinel) is one such SIEM cloud-based tool providing capabilities such as security analytics, threat intelligence, threat response, and more in a single platform.  In this project, we will leverage Azure resources like Log Analytics workspace and use KQL query to detect security events in the Windows operating system. 

<h2>Part 1: Setting Up Lab Resources</h2>
1. Created a new Account in Azure. Azure Subscription 1 with $200 credits was provided for free. For this project, a resource group with the name:labgroup was created.
<img src = "images/1.png" height = 400, width = 500>
2. Created a new Virtual Machine to install Windows 10 Pro operating system using the Resources: labgroup. Virtual Machine Name: labvm
<img src = "images/2.1.png" height = 400, width = 500> <img src = "images/2.1.png" height = 400, width = 500> <img src = "images/2.2.png" height = 400, width = 500> <img src = "images/2.3.png" height = 400, width = 500> <img src = "images/2.4.png" height = 400, width = 500>
