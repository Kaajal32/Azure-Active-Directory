<h2>Description</h2>
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System) is a tool security professionals use to analyze logs from different sources such as Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and much more. It helps security professionals to monitor, prioritize, and remediate threats in real-time. Azure Sentinel (Microsoft Sentinel) is one such cloud-based tool providing capabilities such as security analytics, threat intelligence, threat response, and more in a single platform.  In this project, we will leverage Azure resources like Log Analytics workspace and use KQL query to detect security events in the windows operating system.
